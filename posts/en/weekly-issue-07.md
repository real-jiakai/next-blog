Welcome to the seventh issue of "Weekly Insights." This week's topic is "This is very un-open-source."

## Topic: This Is Very Un-Open-Source

The above is Gitee's official response to the measure requiring review before open-source repositories go live. Regarding this, I'm deeply disappointed.

Gitee was forced into this. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires platforms to be responsible for all content on their platforms, so Gitee's management came up with this terrible measure.

The image hosting ban at the end of March, and the repository review-before-going-live policy at the end of May – this series of moves by Gitee has once again lowered my trust in domestic brands.

Bilibili uploader "Monkey King" made a satirical video specifically for this – [What if programmers had to go to a business hall for open-source review](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16R4y1c7sf). 😄😄😄

Gitee's measure was mocked by netizens as "no open-source unless necessary" 😅. Saying more is useless – after all, this is just my personal opinion. Everyone has their own unique perspective. I hope readers of my words can think independently and make their own judgments.

For more responses, see the discussion of this issue on Zhihu: [How do you view the May 18th Gitee requirement that repositories must be reviewed before being open-sourced, with some already open-sourced repositories temporarily closed until they pass review?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/533388365)

## Link Sharing

Another free lofi music site. You can put on headphones while studying and use it as white noise, adding a touch of fun to boring study sessions.

2. [Check weather via command line](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in)

```powershell
# Check weather in Nanjing
curl wttr.in/Nanjing
# Check weather in Haimen District, Nantong
curl wttr.in/Haimen
# Check weather in Zhumadian, Henan
curl wttr.in/Zhumadian
# Check weather in Wuxi
curl wttr.in/Wuxi
```

Of course, the prerequisite for entering these commands is having curl installed on your computer. You can search for specific installation methods yourself.

## Have a great weekend! 😆

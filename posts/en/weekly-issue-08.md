Welcome to the eighth issue of "Weekly Insights." This week's topic is "The trap of the information age—over-consuming content."

## 🔍Gitee Event Sequel

This morning while browsing Bilibili, I saw that Gitee's Bilibili account posted a [9th anniversary live recording](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HS4y1q7Do). Gitee officially responded to the open-source review event that everyone has been concerned about recently. The response to the open-source review event starts at 1 hour 15 minutes and ends around 1 hour 40 minutes in the video. Here are my notes for your reference.

## Topic: The Trap of the Information Age—Over-Consuming Content

In the quotes section of my 6th weekly issue, I cited someone's tweet about "how to become inefficient," which mentioned one point—over-consuming content. Today, I'll use this as a starting point for our discussion.

*What is over-consuming content?*

There's no clear definition of this concept online. In my view, over-consuming content means the information you browse daily exceeds your capacity to handle it. The boundary of this capacity is determined by yourself – everyone's capacity is different. Some people might feel eye strain after just 10 minutes on their phone, while others might spend most of their day online. But without a doubt, when information exceeds your capacity, you'll feel exhausted and no longer want to be bombarded by information.

But people with OCD will continue pushing through exhaustion, not stopping until they've seen everything in their feed. This is a typical case of over-consumption. Over-consuming content can also be considered a symptom of internet addiction.

The image below is from an [article](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/internet-addiction/) about internet addiction on the addiction center website.

I deeply relate to this point because when I first started creating the weekly newsletter, I was always afraid my content wasn't substantial enough. So I would force myself to scroll through all the updates on various platforms every day.

One night, lying in bed, I chatted with my roommate Leizi next to me. I asked, "Leizi, when you're on TikTok, do you force yourself to scroll through all the updates?" He replied, "Videos on TikTok are endless. Usually I just scroll when I'm relaxing. When I'm tired of scrolling, I stop."

That makes sense. Collecting material for the weekly newsletter is similar to scrolling TikTok. I just need to collect some fresh, interesting things from the internet during my limited relaxation time to share with my readers. When I'm tired of collecting, I can stop.

In this age of information explosion, may you avoid falling into the trap of over-consuming content and fully enjoy the benefits of the internet.

## Quotes

1. The people you meet in your life basically won't truly like or care about you. Even if you have good feelings or relationships now, it's temporary and won't last a lifetime. Don't have too high expectations for interpersonal relationships, or you'll definitely be disappointed. You must constantly strive for self-improvement. Almost all your interpersonal relationships are built on the premise that "you are valuable to others." Focus your time and energy on becoming stronger, not on pleasing others.

2. The length of a person's life isn't measured by lifespan but by the richness of experiences. Lying in bed doing nothing but scrolling your phone, a day passes quickly with the feeling of having done nothing – that day was essentially wasted.

## Link Sharing

In my workflow, I use [Cubox](https://cubox.pro/) for collecting materials. I've been using this software since last year, collecting for nearly half a year, and the contents became messy and numerous. On the evening of May 22nd, I spent an entire evening archiving materials I wouldn't use again and tagging materials I might use in the future for easy reference later. Originally, this link sharing section only recommends 2 interesting websites, but because I organized my collection box last Sunday, I'm recommending 5 (3+2) interesting websites this time. The first 3 are carefully selected from my past six months of collection.

You can also try using this material collection software, but it's not suitable for procrastinators – if you don't organize for just one week, your collection box becomes a garbage dump requiring lots of time to clean up. My principle for using this software is to clear it daily.

1. [Time Post Office](https://www.timemailer.cn/#/)

As graduation approaches, why not write a letter to your future self? My college psychology course this semester required writing a letter to my future self. I already submitted my letter on this site in March. I look forward to receiving my March letter next year.

2. [Text Mode](https://earthly-tools.com/text-mode?url=)

View web pages in pure text form. Just enter the website address you want to view after `url=` in the address bar.

3. [What Human Foods are Healthy for Dogs to Eat?](https://www.pawmenow.com/what-dogs-can-eat/)

A site to determine which human foods are healthy for dogs. For example, when I entered "rice," the following prompt appeared.

4. [emojied](https://emojied.net/)

Shorten your links using emojis. For example, my personal blog link is `https://jiakai.page`. After conversion through this site, it becomes `https://emojied.net/😉🙃😌😨😍😰`.

5. [batnoter](https://batnoter.com/)

An open-source, Markdown-based, self-hosted-to-GitHub note-taking web application. You can use it as your own random notebook. [Note: This app was originally called gitnoter, later renamed to batnoter]

After saving notes, they automatically sync to your GitHub repository.

When I'm not busy, I use this software to record interesting and fresh things I encounter. When I'm busy, I still use Cubox to save interesting and fresh things, then organize them when I have free time.

## Fun Facts

1. An interesting Truth from Trump.

Translation:

> I collected billions of dollars from South Korea to make them, a very wealthy country, pay something for their military protection. Biden just walked away, asking for nothing. They think we're too stupid.

## Have a great weekend! 😆

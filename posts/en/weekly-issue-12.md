On December 7, 1972, astronauts on Apollo 17 took this photo of Earth on their way to the Moon. Today known as the "Blue Marble," this photo has become one of the most iconic images of our home. [Image source](https://www.nasa.gov/content/blue-marble-image-of-the-earth-from-apollo-17)

The Shenzhou-14 manned spaceflight mission (June 5 to December 4, 2022) was the first manned spaceflight mission in China's space station construction phase, carrying three astronauts: Chen Dong, Cai Xuzhe, and Liu Yang. Image two was taken by astronaut Chen Dong during the mission. Based on my comparison with maps, image two shows China's Yellow River estuary.

Apollo 17 was humanity's last trip to the Moon. Humans haven't returned to the Moon in the past 50 years because lunar missions are extremely expensive, and the Moon is basically a barren desert—it's not worth spending a fortune to send astronauts for a stroll. However, China hasn't landed on the Moon yet, and the technology and experience for lunar landing are essential. Currently, China's manned space program's three-step strategy has reached the third step. I believe that someday in the future, China will also achieve its lunar landing dream.

## Topic: How to Break Through During Graduation Season?

Teacher Ruan Yifeng discussed in last year's newsletter article—<a href="https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2022/12/weekly-issue-235.html#comment-text" target="_blank">Youth Unemployment Rate and Choosing Entrepreneurship</a>—why it's difficult for fresh graduates to start businesses and how to cope with the severe employment situation. Recommended reading.

Today is January 12, 2023, with only 5 months left until the Class of 2023 graduates. If the postgraduate exam doesn't work out, what should we do? In the remaining 5 months, how can computer science students make efforts? I'll share my personal views on these two questions.

Of course, if you're very confident about your postgraduate entrance exam, you can start preparing for the interview in advance without worrying too much about future employment—passing the exam will delay your job search, giving you another 2-3 years as a student. If you're not confident about the initial exam, you can either start preparing for the interview or wait until the scores come out to make interview plans.

For those not confident about the initial exam and not busy with interview preparation, here are my suggestions for entering the workforce:

First, choose one programming language to study deeply, gradually meeting the requirements of your desired position. That is, learn relevant technologies based on job requirements.

As shown in the image below, describing the requirements for a Go language backend development position. If you're interested in this position, you can follow the description and learn the relevant technologies step by step.

![Go language backend development requirements](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/13/Rdk8iwLGzchN2jE.webp)

Second, focus on developing self-learning abilities. Pay attention to computer fundamentals and don't over-rely on technical frameworks.

![Today's developers](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/13/1q3K5fZjkFLaDHc.webp)

Undoubtedly, technical frameworks are your stepping stone for future employment—they're indeed important, but computer fundamentals are more important. For example, before learning Vue, a frontend framework, you must solidify your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, etc. Frameworks provide you with a template; you don't need to reinvent the wheel from scratch. Just consult the official documentation, combine it with your needs to write code, and you can achieve your desired functionality. But the unchanging foundation behind these frameworks is always computer fundamentals.

Self-learning ability is also crucial—it determines how far you can go. Technology iterates too fast. To avoid being eliminated by the times, you must learn to self-study. Initially, you might choose to watch videos on Bilibili to learn a programming language, but when you learn another language, can you self-study just from the official documentation? This is a test of your self-learning ability. If you can't, you'll only learn some commonly used knowledge, and when asked to explain deeper content, you'll be at a loss.

Self-learning ability isn't innate or achieved overnight. It requires deliberate practice—push yourself to self-study, and gradually you'll appreciate the charm of self-learning.

Third, find the value, meaning, and original intention of learning. Don't let learning become low-level, inefficient training. [via](https://weibo.com/2365961811/MijbVmz6O) Cultivate your own personality and interests.

High school study might just be to cope with the college entrance exam; university study might just be for graduation and postgraduate exams. But think carefully—how much does this actually improve you? Never let your student life wear down your edges.

There's an interesting phenomenon on university campuses: in freshman year, there are still several students who actively speak up in class. But as time goes on, few students actively participate. After a teacher poses a question, there's dead silence. In my view, this deserves attention. If you have ideas, you should boldly raise your hand to share and demonstrate your ideas and confidence.

The value, meaning, and original intention of learning is to improve yourself—both in ability and other aspects. You might initially know nothing about computer science, but as you learn, I hope you'll fall in love with your major and its field. Remember to follow tech news regularly and keep a pulse on the industry.

Interest is the best teacher. Only when you're passionate enough can you learn faster and more. In my view, the best way to combat involution is to cultivate your own interests and personality.

In summary, stay sharp, keep learning, love life, and find your foothold in society early. Keep looking up at the stars, open your eyes to the world—don't limit your vision to just your university or your country. Think globally!

1. Vietnamese Year of the Cat.

![2023 is the Year of the Cat in Vietnam](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/12/41sMXQYEyi6Hp29.webp)

![2023 Spring Festival Gala mascot—Rabbit Yuanyuan](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/12/oc4JLFOeq6m9KSA.webp)

Like China, Spring Festival is Vietnam's most important traditional holiday. But unlike China, Vietnam's zodiac uses the Cat instead of the Rabbit. There are various explanations for this. One theory suggests that when Chinese culture spread to Vietnam, Vietnamese people misheard "Year of Mao (Rabbit)" as "Year of Mao (Cat)"; another theory maintains that Vietnamese value "ecological balance"—since there's a Rat in the zodiac, the Cat can counter it. <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8C%AB%E5%B9%B4/4943704" target="_blank">via</a>

2. Web Development Acronyms

When I first encountered this image, I didn't look carefully and saved it to my bookmarks. When I later had time to review it, I found the image was completely nonsense—it can be seen as a humor image from programmers. The real web development acronyms are shown below.

![Developer behavior analysis](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/12/OPmS3EAInfD5kNH.webp)

Chinese developers like to star repositories, with WatchEvent at 17.23% and ForkEvent at 2.7%. This probably describes GitHub users like me. In the past year, I starred nearly 3,000 repositories, but I've actually used and understood very few. So a few days ago, I removed all my stars. Using GitHub's API can quickly accomplish clearing all stars.

In my view, Chinese developers need to work harder—transition from Watch, Fork, Star to Pull Request. Contribute more code; change the world with code.

The article mentioned that the top language in the open-source world over the past four years is JavaScript. Below is a joke image about JS that I saw in a group.

5. Two Ways to Browse GitHub Repositories in VSCode Mode

1) Change the domain github.com to github.dev / Press the period (.) key on your keyboard

2) Add 1s after github in the domain

This website shows the monthly income levels of families around the world. You can adjust the range yourself—the further left the range, the poorer the family; the further right, the wealthier. It's not hard to see that the gap between rich and poor in the world is still quite large. But for human society to progress, there must be differences. If egalitarianism is adopted, people's laziness will inevitably increase, and the spirit of striving and chasing dreams will be worn down.

This website was created by Joey Cato from the San Francisco Bay Area in California, USA. It shows us the content broadcast on American TVs in the 1980s. The TV I opened in the image above is playing a music program. Joey Cato likes to create interactive, nostalgic things in his spare time. He believes it's a fun way to exercise his passion for learning. [via](https://www.joeycato.com)

It's not hard to see that besides 80s TV, there are also 60s, 70s, 90s, and 00s TVs. This webmaster's creative spirit is worth learning from.

Su Shi, a poet from China's Northern Song Dynasty, once wrote: "Ask about my life's achievements: Huangzhou, Huizhou, Danzhou." This fully demonstrates his open-minded self-deprecation despite being demoted.

But a question remains: where exactly are Huangzhou, Huizhou, and Danzhou? Through this website, you can clearly see Su Dongpo's footprints throughout his life and the locations of those three states at that time.

This website records the top scorers in elite clubs since 1980. Data sources include Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and other competitions.

When it comes to football, people's first impression is Messi and Ronaldo. The reason is that these two legends have the highest goal rankings, as clearly shown in the image above.

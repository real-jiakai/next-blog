A romantic and beautiful song. Being far away in Guangxi, I can't help but miss the people, events, and things in Jiangsu.

In 2024, at the "Forging a Strong Sense of Community for the Chinese Nation" themed event held at Guangxi Minzu University, I, as someone from Jiangsu, experienced the March Third festival for the first time. This experience gave me a deep appreciation for the profound depth and unique charm of Chinese culture.

## Topic: The Dilemma of Pursuing a Master's at a Non-Elite University

As a graduate student who sees graduate school as a way to delay employment pressure, these past few months have completely shown me the predicament I might face in future employment. The destinations of third-year graduate students are good references for first-year students.

A third-year senior sister published a quality paper in the Chinese Journal of Computers during her studies, becoming the only candidate with a chance to pursue a PhD. The other seniors, after completing their theses, all returned home to find jobs. Generally, they consider public sector positions. Their employment direction has no intersection with the natural language processing they studied.

This inevitably makes one question the meaning and value of NLP graduate studies, because my institution's NLP research focuses on niche ASEAN minority languages. The lack of corpora + lack of GPU equipment + no market demand for employment inevitably leads to the awkward position of being neither here nor there—quite a waste of time.

Generally, computer-related majors consider development positions after graduation. But if you completely abandon development learning during graduate school and don't intern much, development positions are mostly out of reach. This situation is very common among graduate students at my institution.

How to break through? Obviously, by doing development. After completing coursework and research direction tasks, squeeze out time to learn development. Also, finish publishing papers early—only after papers are done will you have spare time to intern at companies.

Enough said. After finishing this monthly issue, I'm off to continue learning development.

Welcome to the sixth issue of "Weekly Insights." This week's topic is "Have you achieved music freedom?"

## Topic: Have You Achieved Music Freedom?

I'm sure you've encountered situations where you have to pay to listen to music. Domestic music giant QQ Music has gone so far as to mark all of Jay Chou's classic songs as VIP-exclusive – they'll do anything for money. 😮‍💨 Jay Chou is a leading figure in Chinese pop music. Just imagine how many fans in mainland China would pay for membership just to listen to his songs.

QQ Music is the vendor with the most music copyrights in mainland China, but their money-grabbing behavior based on their abundant resources disgusts me. [Last month, I had a momentary lapse of judgment and got a QQ Music membership just to listen to a song called "Star Moon Candy." ~~I probably won't renew it~~. **QQ Music is the largest local music platform, and among all music platforms, it offers the best support for Chinese songs. If there's a need, I'll definitely renew!** (Added on 2022.11.12)]

NetEase Cloud Music also has songs that require VIP to listen to...

Music is similar to software – open source has benefits but also drawbacks. For music, if users can listen and download for free, users achieve "music freedom"; but this approach harms music creators' interests and may dampen their creative enthusiasm. For software, if the source code is open, software update iterations speed up, but it may also cause original authors to abandon projects because they can't profit.

I support the music vendor operating model of free listening with paid downloads. The platform takes a small portion of profits, with the rest going to music creators. But I firmly oppose the money-grabbing behavior mentioned above [QQ Music marking almost all of Jay Chou's classic songs as VIP-exclusive].

On foreign platform Spotify, Jay Chou's songs are completely free. Domestic Migu Music also makes almost all Jay Chou songs freely available. Only QQ Music in China is raking in money based on copyrights – I can't stand this behavior.

The comments above reflect Chinese people's inner feelings, but they also reveal the current situation of insufficient copyright awareness among Chinese people. When freeloading becomes a habit, it means repeatedly plundering creators' work. Remember to freeload in moderation – don't treat freeloading as something taken for granted!

This Zhihu answer fully illustrates the current state of the music market. Major music vendors are fighting against each other under the banner of copyright protection for their own interests. [How do you view paying for music?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/320564099/answer/1634954859)

True music freedom doesn't exist – the fact that musicians also need to eat makes it impractical. I hope that while protecting copyrights in the future, capitalists will also restrain their money-grabbing tendencies. Only then will Chinese people be willing to pay for good music.

GitHub is paradise for open-source software, SciHub is paradise for academic papers – is there a music paradise? With an exploratory mindset, I discovered [MusicHub](https://www.music-hub.com/) online, but it's not a music paradise – it's a site that provides convenience for musicians to publish their work.

I checked some related domain names for musichub. Good domain names were registered long ago, but musichub.com isn't active. Good domain names being hoarded is a tragedy of our times, but what can we do? My birth timing meant I missed the domain name boom.

1. How to become inefficient?

- Sit indoors all day
- Don't exercise
- Over-consume content
- Keep your phone next to your desk while working

2. Everyone talks about GPA rankings, national first-class and second-class honors. No one loves knowledge anymore, no one wants to understand problems anymore. Every effort must be resume-worthy, otherwise it's worthless.

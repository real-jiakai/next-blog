Looking closely at the details of Joey Yung's song "9.9 Seconds" released in the first half of this year is touching.

Going home during July summer break, transferring in Nanjing, sitting on Line 1 brought different feelings compared to my college days. From fall 2019 to spring 2023, Line 1 was the starting point of going home; but from fall 2023 to spring 2026, Line 1 has become a transfer point on the way home.

Leaving Jiangsu for Guangxi to pursue my master's is truly leaving home for distant lands. These three years, I need to prepare well for future graduation and employment to have no regrets.

## Topic: The Chosen One—Trump

I first learned about Trump in the second semester of freshman year in 2020. During the pandemic, watching funny videos of Trump on Bilibili's Observer Network and remix videos, adding this entertainment to monotonous repetitive days made life more enjoyable.

Although Trump taking office will definitely be tougher on China, watching the entertainment is really enjoyable.

During summer 2022 when I stayed on campus for graduate exam preparation, with intense summer heat, I wasn't really in the mood for studying. I remember buying a Trump support hat on Taobao during that time.

I only wore this hat in my dorm, looking at myself in the mirror. Never wore it outside. After all, what's a joke to entertainment seekers is seen as politically dangerous by some.

Trump's rhyming campaign slogan MAGA is beloved by many. From 2020 until now, from Bilibili's Observer Network → Bilibili's Panda Baba → Bilibili's Trump Diary, step by step, I've barely missed any of Trump's entertaining speeches.

Trump founded his own social media, and I immediately registered an account to show support. I remember the craziest time was the first half of 2022, when I would retruth every single post Trump made every day—satisfying my curiosity while learning some foreign language. 😂

In 2023, Midjourney went paid. After joining a shared Midjourney account, I generated a bunch of memes for Trump. Trump Bird, Trump Cat, Trump Everything!

I remember Discord had a face-swap bot back then. While playing around, I swapped Trump's face with Biden's and Kun's for entertainment. 😆

Trump's charm is just too powerful—world's number one influencer without a doubt. Most importantly, Trump broke the serious image of political figures, attracting a bunch of entertainment seekers with his humorous, witty, and uninhibited style. Down-to-earth politics is really irresistible.

Thank God for letting Trump dodge the assassination. Biden dropped out. Trump and Harris (Kamala) will have the final battle in November. The Simpsons animation reportedly predicted Harris would become America's first female Black president. I lean toward Trump winning—whoever wins will suppress China. Although Trump winning will definitely mean being tougher on China, at least we get to watch 4 more years of entertainment.

The Chosen One, King of MAGA—may Trump get his wish and take back the White House!

4. Obama throws Biden into the river.

Poor old Biden—his withdrawal statement on X probably wasn't even written by himself. When things go bad, everyone piles on. After the first debate with Trump at the end of June, he lost his appeal. After Trump's shooting, Biden was abandoned by everyone. The bullet hit Trump's ear but pierced Biden's presidential dream. 😜

5. Biden Eyes: O.o🤣

Watching Trump and Biden's debate, Biden's eyes being different sizes is hilarious.

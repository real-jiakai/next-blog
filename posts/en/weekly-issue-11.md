## Topic: Hello 2023

It's been a long time since I wrote a newsletter. I still remember the last time I wrote was in June of last year. In the blink of an eye, 2022 has already left us. Just as shown in the video above, 2022 is no longer in the stream of time.

Whether for the world or for me personally, 2022 was a challenging year.

This year, the pandemic continued to plague the world. Humanity didn't successfully defeat COVID-19; instead, the process of coexisting with it accelerated. This year, many notable figures left us, and with their passing, the cruelty of time was once again displayed before the world. At the end of this year, I successfully joined the Communist Party of China, though I'm well aware that I still have some distance to becoming a qualified party member. This year, for the postgraduate entrance examination at year's end, I gave up programming, hobbies, and more. After the initial exam, knowing that I probably wouldn't succeed in becoming a graduate student on my first attempt, in about half a year I'll likely enter the workforce, learning from experience...

In 2022, [Google's search keyword was "can I change"](https://about.google/stories/year-in-search/); [Oxford Dictionary's word of the year was "goblin mode"](https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2022/); [Bilibili's annual comment was "elegant"](https://www.bilibili.com/blackboard/activity-Lvg7KQjIag.html)...

For me, the keywords of 2022 were the postgraduate exam and graduation. After undergraduate graduation, where should I go? To ease my confusion, I followed the crowd and took the postgraduate exam. At the same time, to prepare for graduation, I was also working on my thesis. My ordinary life was fulfilling yet busy.

1. [Preserving Open Source Software for Future Generations](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)

A project from the world's largest code hosting platform, GitHub—the Archive Program. Reportedly, on February 2, 2020, GitHub captured a snapshot of every active open-source repository and stored it in an abandoned coal mine deep in the Arctic mountains of Svalbard, Norway.

Here's a location map of the Svalbard archipelago, located in northern Europe, close to the North Pole.

3. [AI-Generated Bug Illustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/weirddalle/comments/zi14ae/a_developer_finding_a_bug_now_even_more_literal/)

The term "Bug" in software refers to small errors or glitches in programs. The origin of this term is fascinating—it comes from a moth found in a relay. 2022 can be called the inaugural year of AI art, with various AI painting programs emerging one after another.

A foreign netizen used Midjourney, an AI painting software, to create an image containing a giant bug.

This website is dedicated to preserving and displaying vintage computer systems. The site maintainer is Steve Stengel from Orange County, Los Angeles, California, USA. Based on various materials on the site, he's a vintage computer enthusiast.

Browsing through the timeline on the left side of the website, it's not hard to see that older vintage computer systems were more expensive, while more modern vintage systems were cheaper.

## Documentary

Today I recommend a documentary called "The Internet's Own Boy." This documentary tells the story of Aaron Swartz, who gave his life for a freer and more open internet.

Hello 👋, friend. Starting today, I've decided to write a weekly newsletter sharing what I've seen and heard over the past week.

## Topic: How Are Billionaires Made?

Elon Musk acquired 9.2% of Twitter's shares, becoming the company's largest shareholder. Looking at the Forbes billionaire list with Musk at the top, I couldn't help but wonder: why is this man so successful?

After researching online, I've summarized the following factors that contributed to his success:

- Hard work
- Innovative spirit
- Foresight

Of course, there are many more factors that contributed to his success. In this issue, I'll only discuss three perspectives.

First, hard work is an essential component of success. Slacking off at work and letting your mind wander reduces efficiency, which extends the path to success. Life has only a few critical moments, and if you don't do the right things at the right time, you're destined not to succeed.

I've never seen anyone enjoy the fruits of success without putting in effort. Wang Sicong, son of Wang Jianlin and a "rich second generation," has actually mastered considerable computer knowledge. If you're interested, you can search for "Dianwan Tech" on Bilibili or YouTube – there are several videos about building servers for Wang Sicong. The information revealed in these videos shows that Wang Sicong is not an uneducated idler; he has studied relevant knowledge diligently. Although his success largely depends on his father's wealth, he continues to create new value based on the foundation of inherited wealth.

Technologies like autonomous driving and batteries are all manifestations of Musk's innovative spirit. Although he didn't implement these himself, he initiated their development. It's his pursuit of innovation that gives him innovative awareness.

In his 200th weekly newsletter [*Low Expectations, More Attempts*](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2022/03/weekly-issue-200.html), Ruanyifeng wrote: "We should be as cautious as Munger and as action-oriented as Musk." Munger is the vice chairman of an American investment holding company, known for being cautious and never playing cards he's unsure about. Musk, on the other hand, dares to challenge the unknown. He believed electric vehicles would be the future. As it turns out, electric vehicles align perfectly with today's environmental and green themes, and Tesla's success brought Musk to the peak of his career.

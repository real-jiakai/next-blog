Translation:

> Imagine a world without free knowledge.
>
> For over a decade, we have spent millions of hours building the greatest encyclopedia in human history. Now the US Congress is considering legislation that could ultimately harm the free and open Internet. To raise public awareness, we are shutting down Wikipedia.

On January 18, 2012, Wikipedia shut down the English Wikipedia for 24 hours to protest against two bills being considered by the US Congress (SOPA and PIPA). The conflict between intellectual property and knowledge sharing continues to clash in today's human society. How to find a balance between the two is worth our consideration.

Note:

+ SOPA: Stop Online Piracy Act
+ PIPA: Protect IP Act

## Topic: The Bad Habit of Hoarding Information

A few days ago, I came across an article titled [My bad habit of hoarding information](https://andreisurugiu.com/blog/bad-habit/). The author says he's a tech geek who likes to collect all kinds of interesting information from the internet. In the article, he points out that when the number of links to process in a week grows to over 80, processing all these links is very time-consuming—the workload is enormous.

The author also reflects on why he developed this information-collecting habit. It might be due to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)—afraid of missing interesting links—or perhaps some form of perfectionism. But regardless of the reason, the end result is spending a lot of energy collecting endless links without time to go back and organize them.

Actually, I've experienced this too and have only recently started to adjust. Before writing the blog post ["Read Later = Never Read"](https://blog.gujiakai.top/2023/01/read-later-equals-to-not-read.html), I also suffered from FOMO, afraid of missing various exciting news or trending topics on the internet. But after collecting interesting information, I would put them in cold storage, leaving them to gather dust in my bookmarks.

As my bookmarks accumulated more and more, I could no longer tolerate this inefficient, futile collecting. Although there are indeed gems in my bookmarks, most are certainly garbage that doesn't help my personal improvement. So I started clearing bookmarks across all platforms.

I still collect links, but my current collecting has an additional layer of filtering compared to before—that filter is my reading. Only those links that I find valuable and have actually read will I add to my bookmarks for sharing or revisiting later. But these links that make it to my bookmarks are few. Most links I encounter in a day, I close after reading and never let them pollute my bookmarks.

In recent years, various productivity software has emerged endlessly, but have these productivity tools really improved my efficiency? I always reflect on this question. At first, I focused on writing in Typora. Later, hearing that Notion and Obsidian were powerful, I tried writing diaries or notes in these apps, but the results were unsatisfactory. When Notion's new AI feature and Obsidian's new canvas feature launched, they stirred up excitement in the productivity software tinkering community, but I ultimately chose to leave and continue using Typora for writing.

Actually, tinkering with productivity software and hoarding information are the same principle. The essence is that you're trying to use your limited energy to gather unlimited knowledge or engage in endless tinkering to obtain continuous dopamine hits. In this process, you do gain pleasure, but you also scatter your energy, thus reducing your quality of life.

In the [HackerNews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34272834) about the [My bad habit of hoarding information](https://andreisurugiu.com/blog/bad-habit/) article, I saw some comments like this. The commenter below is a cautionary tale—he has 24,000+ links stored in the OneTab browser extension. If he doesn't clear them, I estimate he'll have difficulty consuming so many links in his lifetime.

One commenter shared experience drawn from recent reading: focus on knowledge output rather than knowledge consumption.

![HackerNews discussion image two](https://vip2.loli.net/2023/01/20/ZvlDN7FImTPnes2.webp)

I quite agree with this view. Writing newsletters is a form of knowledge output. Even if the newsletter goes unnoticed, that's not something I should worry about. My focus is on completing and proofreading the newsletter and publishing it, sharing my thoughts with the world—being a knowledge producer in addition to being a consumer.

"My life has limits, but knowledge has none." To pursue the limitless with the limited will exhaust you and leave you empty-handed. Don't use your finite life chasing infinite knowledge.

If there really were a technology that could permanently store all the links you visit daily and provide search functionality, hoarding information wouldn't be a concern—you'd just need to tag well when hoarding, and when writing later, you could search for whatever knowledge you need. Undeniably, reading an article before citing it leaves the deepest impression, but unfortunately, no such service exists.

Therefore, abandoning the bad habit of hoarding information early and focusing more on knowledge output alongside knowledge input is the royal road to escaping the information explosion era.

1. On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog. This cartoon was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1993, fully embodying the anonymity of the internet. In the 21st century today, there's virtually no privacy left—unless you go offline, you're completely exposed. When you use an app and thoughtlessly check "I have read and agree to the relevant terms of service," you've already sold yourself to tech giants.

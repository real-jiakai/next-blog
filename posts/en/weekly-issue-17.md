A very warm song—listening to it when exhausted can be healing.

After my senior labmate finished his pre-defense, he moved out of the lab. Seeing others nearing graduation brings a mix of envy and an indescribable melancholy.

Envious of my senior escaping the sea of suffering, starting a new chapter in life; seeing him leave, I seem to see a miniature of my last days at Xiaozhuang last year.

## Topic: Reflections on One Year as a VPS Enthusiast

My first contact with VPS was at the end of 2021. It was near Double Eleven (Singles' Day shopping festival), and knowing nothing, I bought a VPS with non-optimized routing from Bandwagon Host's homepage.

This situation continued until late January/early February 2023, when I was still using an airport (proxy service). I only had 3 VPS: 1 was Bandwagon's homepage sucker deal [thinking it was premium routing], and the other two were Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud student machines in China.

The reason I didn't self-host nodes was because I bought Bandwagon's sucker deal [thinking it was premium routing], and following YouTube tutorials to set up nodes, the results were poor.

When using the airport's US nodes to access GPT, I found only some nodes worked while others didn't. So I began my self-hosting journey.

In the second semester of senior year, I tried AWS Lightsail, Bandwagon's DC9 datacenter machine, Bandwagon's Plan V2. Then in the first semester of grad school, I tried DMIT's $37 machine, DMIT's $100 machine, Xianyu Cloud's 9929, CN2 GIA line, Zgo's triple-network optimized line, V.ps's Vpack machine, and so on.

Currently, I have 50+ VPS. I've become an MJJ [slang for "没鸡鸡" (no d*ck), referring to people who love buying VPS, tinkering with them after purchase, letting them collect dust, then buying new ones to tinker with again—an endless cycle of enjoyment].

This journey has cost quite a bit of money, and I've also introduced a roommate I'm close with to VPS—he now has about 10 machines.

But the process of buying and tinkering with machines is indeed quite enjoyable. Currently, I've self-hosted over 100 services, with the ones I use regularly being Vaultwarden [password manager], RSSHub, etc.

For 2024, I'm setting a small goal for myself: try to reduce my machine count to 30-40, reduce my expenses, and become a financially responsible VPS enthusiast.

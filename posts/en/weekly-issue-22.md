An insert song from the TV drama "A Thousand Peach Blossoms Bloom in One Lifetime." Huang Ling's enchanting vocal inflections, paired with the drama's story, make for an enjoyable experience.

Winter in the countryside is cold and bleak.

## Topic: He Has Returned Like Lightning

He, meaning Donald J. Trump, unsurprisingly won the 2024 US presidential election. Before last year's election, I knew he would win, and the final result was exactly as expected—he has returned like lightning.

An influencer president, quite interesting. The next 4 years will have lots of entertainment.

Trump and his wife each issued their own cryptocurrency during his inauguration—the scalping operation is amusing.

At the inauguration ceremony, there were many interesting memes too, like Zuckerberg side-eyeing Bezos's wife's curves.

Trump's statements seem quite normal compared to some Democratic figures—he believes there are only two genders: male and female, opposes illegal immigration, etc. His victory was expected. Biden dropped out, Kamala flopped, even with mainstream media siding with Democrats, it didn't help. This victory can be called a victory of common sense.

Trump described his victory as "Too big to rig"—all swing states went to Trump, truly a surge of public opinion.

Trump's strategy is America First—whenever America loses out, he uses tariffs, sanctions, and other means to pressure you.

Although he'll definitely suppress China's development, putting politics aside, you have to admire that this person is truly legendary. He uses his name as a brand and business card—his fame is probably Top 1 on Earth. He's too good at creating topics—trending topics are made for him. He's entertaining while holding great power—too attention-grabbing.

The White House website has a big Trump logo—truly amazing!

Looking forward to more entertaining content from Trump over the next 4 years. After the basic move of leaving groups, bring on more fun.

1. Will open-source models fall further behind? 😁

Li Yanhong's funny statement fits my stereotype of Baidu. DeepSeek, Qwen, and other domestic open-source LLMs are slapping his face hard. Wenxin Yiyan probably can't even beat these open-source models now.

This is a website recording AI benchmarks surpassed by large language models (LLMs), showing the rapid progress of AI development. Take benchmarks with a grain of salt—in my view, LLMs aren't good at reasoning. Rather than saying they can reason, it's more like they're imitating. Similar problems with changed data will confuse them.

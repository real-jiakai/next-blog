Welcome to the second issue of "Weekly Insights." This week's topic is "Have you experienced SEO pollution?"

## Topic: Have You Experienced SEO Pollution?

SEO pollution contaminates the internet just like garbage pollutes the environment.

First, let me explain what SEO pollution is. The following definition is from Baidu Encyclopedia.

A few days ago, I came across a Zhihu topic recommended by other bloggers: [Is the output of the Chinese internet gradually withering?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/49684783/answer/2305132342)

After reading others' responses, I deeply resonated with them. Especially as a computer science student like me, when I encounter problems and ask search engines, the results are often filled with unbearable garbage. Sites like "Programmer Baby" and "Programmer Base" that scrape content are truly disgusting.

Take an article I published on Blog Garden about [Gitee image hosting being banned](http://www.manongjc.com/detail/29-zexdztdpcwouzfc.html) [the original has been completely deleted; you can see the scraper site's backup] – I was one of the first bloggers to publish related articles. The day after I posted it, when I searched for my article on various search engines, I found that scraper sites had already collected my article 😅.

These scraper sites aggregate all kinds of blog posts, but this type of aggregation is meaningless. To put it bluntly, it's just a garbage site collecting garbage.

This is what netizens think of CSDN. I've seen this type of blog post – although the hyperlink might eventually solve my problem, I have no gratitude toward the blogger who provided the hyperlink. I'm only grateful to the original author. CSDN is a garbage site. Although it may contain some quality articles from bloggers, overall the blog quality is low. This is one reason I left CSDN.

Fed up with the search experience polluted by SEO, how can we break through?

Last December, I discovered [ublacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) and [uBlacklist subscription compilation](https://github.com/eallion/uBlacklist-subscription-compilation). It can block specific websites from appearing in Google and Bing search results – just follow the simple configuration in the GitHub repository's README. Since Baidu search engine results are mostly garbage anyway, I don't plan to explore methods for blocking specific sites from Baidu search results. For users in mainland China, I recommend using Bing search; if possible, use Google search.

## Quotes

1. Writing is our external scaffolding; writing itself is thinking. [via](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16T4y197ka)

2. The following is a quote from the movie "The Wandering Earth." Looking at it now, how fitting it is for our current situation. COVID-19 has ravaged us for three years and continues to do so – this is a disaster. But we cannot be pessimistic because of COVID; we must continue to love life as always.

> At first, no one cared about this disaster. It was just a wildfire, a drought, the extinction of a species, the disappearance of a city – until this disaster became closely related to everyone.
